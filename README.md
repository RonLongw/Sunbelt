# Sunbelt

The solution contains an MVC project and a SQL Server DB project.

There are two database scripts one is there to create tables in case the SQL server DB project does not work
The other script populates two of the look up tables.

The scripts are located in the PartyPlanner project under a folder called "SQL Scripts"
